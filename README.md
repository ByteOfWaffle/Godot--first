# 🥷Stealth Platformer Game Project🥷

## Overview
This is a platformer game with the following key features:

- Stealth (ability to hide)
- Timed levels to encourage competitivness in players.
- Saving game progress
- Ability to transfer saves to and from a database

The game involves navigating through levels filled with obstacles and enemies, using stealth mechanics to avoid detection. 

## Saving and Save Transfer

The game will save the players progress after a level. The save data is first stored locally on the player's device.

Additionally, the saved game data can be transferred to and from a database. This enables them to continue their game on different devices, or to restore a previous save if needed.

The save transfer functionality is integrated with a backend database, allowing the game to securely store and retrieve player progress.

## Technical Details

The game and database is built using the following technologies:

- Platform: Windows(game), Linux(database)
- Engine: Godot
- Programming Language: GDscript
- Database: Probably some kinda SQL-based database, Still tryna figure it out.


## Progress
Current progresson and future plans can be found in the Kanban and issues page

I welcome any feedback to help shape the development of this game.
