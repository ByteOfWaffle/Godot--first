# 🥷 Stealth Platformer Game Project 🥷

## 📋 Overview
This is a platformer game with the following key features:

- 👻 Stealth (ability to hide)
- ⏱️ Timed levels to encourage competitivness in players.
- 💾 Saving game progress
- 🔄 Ability to transfer saves to and from a database

The game involves navigating through levels filled with obstacles and enemies, using stealth mechanics to avoid detection. 

## 💾 Saving and Save Transfer

The game will save the players progress after a level. The save data is first stored locally on the player's device.

Additionally, the saved game data can be transferred to and from a database. This enables them to continue their game on different devices, or to restore a previous save if needed.

The save transfer functionality is integrated with a backend database, allowing the game to securely store and retrieve player progress.

- 🖥️ Platform: Windows(game), Linux(database)
